# story-builder-quest
Generative AI streamlit app to iteratively tell bed time stories for kids.

App overview:
A problem I noticed as an aunt of a 3-year old is that entertaining and engaging young kids can be very challenging, especially as a busy working parent. This inspired to dig deeper to design a streaming solution for parents to keep their kids engaged.

I conducted 20 user interviews to learn more about user preferences and identified user needs that I aimed to solve for with this app. Analyzing this further, narrowed me down into an interactive, audio-only tool that could iteratively create stories based on inputs from the kids. The key insights, product strategy, and GTM strategy is captured in the product pitch PDF.

This app creates the interactive and iterative story-builder and allows the user to save the output. Based on my testing, it seems to do this effectively. 

User inputs:
- Topic that they want to generate a story about. 
- The age of the child playing.
- The number of minutes they want the story to be. This is used to calculate the number of prompts (assuming each prompt takes about 2 minutes to get through).
- Their child's name. The intent is that the generated story will replace the main character's name with the child in question.

The model will leverage research from Wikipedia and Langchain to come up with story chunks of length of about 3-5 sentences. Until it reaches the last chunk, the model will generate chunks that end in a prompt for the user to continue the story and display an area to make the choice for how the story should continue. The model then takes this input, and continues the story for the next chunk. In the last chunk, the model is supposed to conclude the story. 

Key Class Concepts Used:
- Langchain to build the random story outputs based on user input.
- Streamlit to design the front end for the app. 
- Prompt engineering to design the prompts for the Langchain.

App risks and shortcomings:
Sometimes the output generated by the model isn't perfect -- in particular, two trends I noticed is that each output didn't always adhere to the 3-5 sentence limit and the main character's name wasn't always what the user provided. This is something that I could further refine with fine-tuning.
